# Spring Boot Project Structure Prompt

To generate a standard Spring Boot application project structure, include the following folders and files:

- src/main/java: Main source code directory
- src/main/resources: Configuration files and resources
- src/test/java: Test source code directory
- pom.xml or build.gradle: Build configuration file
- application.properties or application.yml: Application configuration
- README.md: Project documentation

Ensure the project follows best practices for package naming, modularity, and includes example controller, service, and repository classes.

Add additional folders or files as needed for your specific use case (e.g., static, templates, Dockerfile).
